# *Round Robin Scheduler*
This C program simulates a Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm. It handles multiple processes with CPU and I/O bursts, simulates their execution, and generates statistics for CPU utilization, turnaround time, and wait time.

## Key Features
Process States: Manages processes through states: NEW, READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED, and EXIT.

Round Robin Scheduling: Implements time-quantum-based preemption for fair sharing of CPU time.

Supports I/O Bursts: Simulates I/O operations between CPU bursts.

## Statistics:
CPU Utilization.

Average Turnaround Time.

Average Waiting Time.
